# hello-world
2018/5/12/22:48. It is my first time to use Github as my learning track that is meaningful in some ways.

hello everyone!
    my name is dongjingtao, i like movies, musics, and more importantly, i like python, although i'm a new learner. I enjoy the feeling to organize my own codes as a tool to fix problems. Sincerely, I'm very happy to be here to learn more and develop myself in future. Thank you, my friend!
